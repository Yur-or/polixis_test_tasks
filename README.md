# Polixis test tasks
Repository for solving a test task from Polixis

## First task:
You need to train a topic classifier. The dataset can be found in folder data.
There are no restrictions regarding algorithms/libraries/architectures to use. 
Please keep in mind that the code needs to be deployment-ready. 
Even though simpler solutions would also work we would like to see a transformer-based solution.
You are also welcome to have more than one solution.

## Second task:
For the second, easier task you are required to create a program that will return name equivalence pairs.
You can find the dataset attached below.
The dataset we provide contains a sample of English and Arabic equivalent names.
Arabic names contain more than one equivalents, separated with simbold ØŒ or ;  while English ones contain only one name. 
Your program should return Arabic-English pairs and Arabic-Arabic all possible pair combinations in separate files.
Note that if ('a', 'c') and ('c', 'a') are the same pair and only one of them should be returned.


It's best to have it all done by Friday. Let's go!!!
